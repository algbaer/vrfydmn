Usage
=====

Install libmilter and pymilter (the python package that wraps the C library).
After that you may create a user milter with group milter. I have provided two
init scripts. The vrfydmn.init is for systems that use sysvinit, the
vrfydmn.openrc is for Gentoo users (as I am). You may edit these and specify
options for the milter. Simply call the milter with --help to get an idea.

Place vrfydmn into /usr/local/sbin. If you chose another path, you might need
to adopt the path in the init script.

You must specify a domain mapping file (Postfix style) with the option '-f', or
the milter will accept all mail. This is due the fact that other backends will
be implemented and the 'file' backend is the first method that is currently
usable.

In Postfix, you may add the milter with:

	non_smtpd_milters=inet:[::1]:30072

for scenario one and

	smtpd_milters=inet:[::1]:30072

for the submission instance. Usually found in master.cf or maybe a second
instance. This depends on your system.
