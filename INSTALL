Usage
=====

Install libmilter and pymilter (the python package that wraps the C library).
After that you may create a user milter with group milter. I have provided two
init scripts. The vrfydmn.init is for systems that use sysvinit, the
vrfydmn.openrc is for Gentoo users (as I am). You may edit these and specify
options for the milter. Simply call the milter with --help to get an idea.

Place vrfydmn into /usr/local/sbin. If you chose another path, you might need
to adopt the path in the init script.

You need to run the milter with -f or -l (see --help).

In Postfix, you may add the milter with:

	non_smtpd_milters=inet:[::1]:30072

for scenario one and

	smtpd_milters=inet:[::1]:30072

for the submission instance. Usually found in master.cf or maybe a second
instance. This depends on your system.

LDAP
====

You can use LDAP. For this, you need to install python-ldap (with SASL support)

For an example config file, see doc/relay_domains.cf

Full documentation will come soon.

Memcached
=========

You can run LDAP combined with memcached. For this, add:

-m 127.0.0.1:11211

as argument in the init script.

Positive results are stored for one hour, negative for 60 seconds.
